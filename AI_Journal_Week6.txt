Week 1

For this week, I used AI to help me learn about the different job opportunities 
around the UMD campus. I am in the process of finding job opportunities, and wanted
to look for some around campus. It's crucial to understand the different types of
jobs offered at the campus and want more background, specifically in the food places
on campus. Here is my AI chat link:

I also used AI to help me find more information on a CS50 class I was taking over
the summer to prepare for Python programming! I have not had any big experiences
using Python before or worked on projects with Python, so I wanted to
get more background knowledge with Python by taking the course. I wanted to understand
if I could get a certificate; however, I wasn't sure, and wanted to clarify that I
could get a certificate after completing the course. Below is the AI chat link:

Week 2

This week, I wanted to learn more about music possibilities around the UMD campus.
I wanted to find places that I would be able to go to to learn, and find people who
share the same interests as me. I know that UMD has a lot to offer, and I wanted
to find ways that students like myself can try and learn to make music on campus
It was just something I wanted to look into. Here is the link to my AI chat:

Other than that, I also used AI to help me a bit with ideas for INST314, because
As I was listening to lectures, I got lost on a few issues with binomials and
wanted to be sure I understood how binomials in data actually work. Since I am
learning a lot about data science, I want to be sure I understand my professors
lectures, and sometimes I like to use AI in order to help me understand something
I may have missed, and that is important to me.

Week 3

Throughout the week, there was a career fair going on! At UMD, a lot of tech companies
came to UMD to discuss with other students about opportunities for internships, job
opportunities, and connections/networking opportunities. When I went, I wanted to
learn more about a specific tech company called "ManTech". They are a tech and
government contract company that helps the government in different departments
and creates tools using code. Below is the link to the AI chat I asked to learn more:

Also, just yesterday, I asked ChatGPT about a really interesting query, because I was
chatting with a "Marine Officer" about taking courses to be in the Marines and 
work later in the future after I finish my degree at UMD. However, when I received a
Weird message saying I have to fill out information from a public source/company,
and get a message with an address from an office no one can find online... I was
hesitant. I asked ChatGPT for more information if it could find anything with the
information I gave it. Below you can see the link to the AI chat to know more:

Week 4

This week, I was trying to understand the clear difference between being in the army
full-time and being in the National Guard. I have a strong interest in joining the
army, since I have family that has done it before. I learned some information about the 
difference in retirement benefits, and figured out when pay starts after retirement for 
both options. I also wanted to learn about other benefits that could happen after army 
life, or during, to brainstorm about what I should do in the future. Link to AI Chat:

Additionally, I asked AI a simple query regarding tips for an interview. Throughout
The time I applied for opportunities, I stumbled across a restaurant called
"Woodmont Grill". They are a restaurant located in Bethesda. I got called for an
interview with them, and wanted to search for a simple query to understand how to speak
to an interviewer and be prepared, and stay honest with them as much as I can, to not 
sound over dramatic. Below is the link to the AI Chat:

Week 5

For this week, I used AI in different ways. For one, because I am in the Caribbean Dance
Team, I was looking for Spooky Dance Ideas for Halloween week! Our dance team is trying
to put on a Caribbean dance performance for the campus, so we can show off our moves
for Halloween week. We were trying to look for some ideas of costumes we can wear, and
how they could contribute to our team. We came across different ideas such as zombies,
ghosts, skeletons, superheroes, and spies. We think we may try to do the spy idea and
see if there is a way to implement that with our team. Below is the link to the AI chat:

This week I have also eaten at a Mexican restaurant! It was amazing, and I realized that
Lots of Mexican restaurants always serve limes with our food. My parents told me that
sometimes limes can help digest any plate of food better, especially if the food is not
all the way cooked. Lime is a great addition to food, especially at Mexican places. I
wanted to look for more details about it, and I got more information by asking AI about
the background of using Limes. I love Mexican restaurants, and I love how in most Spanish
cultures, everyone uses limes with their food. Below is the link to the AI chat:

Week 6

I had to urgently find a parking spot this week, because I was getting ready to enter the
Xfinity Center parking lot, and I was running late. However, I was not sure if I was
able to park my car in the lot close to the Xfinity Center, since I am aware that many
students need parking permits beforehand, before actually parking a vehicle there. However,
I was also aware that at a certain time during the week, students would be able to park
no restrictions in certain parking areas. I had to make sure urgently if I was able to
park next to the Xfinity Center without any issues occurring, and I could do so. Below
is the link to the AI chat: https://chatgpt.com/share/68fa330b-a8ac-8011-9fc3-aee1dd27b56c

I also have a strong interest in real estate. I did some research on it, but wanted a bigger
picture as to what it is and how the real estate business works. In the future, I plan on
working towards this goal as well and having the knowledge to get into this field. There are
also opportunities with UMD to learn more about Real Estate as well, and I found it really cool.
I was also thinking about taking some classes if possible, just to get some background info on
it. I asked ChatGPT for answers regarding Real Estate for a minor and the process of obtaining
one. The link here to AI chat: https://chatgpt.com/share/68fa3430-243c-8011-b9ac-491f9f2da11a
