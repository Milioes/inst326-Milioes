Week 1

For this week, I used AI to help me learn about the different job opportunities 
around the UMD campus. I am in the process of finding job opportunities, and wanted
to look for some around campus. It's crucial to understand the different types of
jobs offered at the campus and want more background, specifically in the food places
on campus. Here is my AI chat link:

I also used AI to help me find more information on a CS50 class I was taking over
the summer to prepare for Python programming! I have not had any big experiences
using Python before or worked on projects with Python, so I wanted to
get more background knowledge with Python by taking the course. I wanted to understand
if I could get a certificate; however, I wasn't sure, and wanted to clarify that I
could get a certificate after completing the course. Below is the AI chat link:

Week 2

This week, I wanted to learn more about music possibilities around the UMD campus.
I wanted to find places that I would be able to go to to learn, and find people who
share the same interests as me. I know that UMD has a lot to offer, and I wanted
to find ways that students like myself can try and learn to make music on campus
It was just something I wanted to look into. Here is the link to my AI chat:

Other than that, I also used AI to help me a bit with ideas for INST314, because
As I was listening to lectures, I got lost on a few issues with binomials and
wanted to be sure I understood how binomials in data actually work. Since I am
learning a lot about data science, I want to be sure I understand my professors
lectures, and sometimes I like to use AI in order to help me understand something
I may have missed, and that is important to me.

Week 3

Throughout the week, there was a career fair going on! At UMD, a lot of tech companies
came to UMD to discuss with other students about opportunities for internships, job
opportunities, and connections/networking opportunities. When I went, I wanted to
learn more about a specific tech company called "ManTech". They are a tech and
government contract company that helps the government in different departments
and creates tools using code. Below is the link to the AI chat I asked to learn more:

Also, just yesterday, I asked ChatGPT about a really interesting query, because I was
chatting with a "Marine Officer" about taking courses to be in the Marines and 
work later in the future after I finish my degree at UMD. However, when I received a
Weird message saying I have to fill out information from a public source/company,
and get a message with an address from an office no one can find online... I was
hesitant. I asked ChatGPT for more information if it could find anything with the
information I gave it. Below you can see the link to the AI chat to know more:
