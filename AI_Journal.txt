Week 1

For this week, I used AI to help me learn about the different job opportunities 
around the UMD campus. I am in the process of finding job opportunities, and wanted
to look for some around campus. It's crucial to understand the different types of
jobs offered at the campus and want more background, specifically in the food places
on campus. Here is my AI chat link:

I also used AI to help me find more information on a CS50 class I was taking over
the summer to prepare for Python programming! I have not had any big experiences
using Python before or worked on projects with Python, so I wanted to
get more background knowledge with Python by taking the course. I wanted to understand
if I could get a certificate; however, I wasn't sure, and wanted to clarify that I
could get a certificate after completing the course. Below is the AI chat link:
